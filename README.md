# AWS/UE5 Pixel Streaming

All of this is for testing purposes and shouldn't be deployed in production!

## Need...
Infra:
- [X] S3 Bucket and Cloudfront Distribution for the frontend
- [ ] API Gateway and a Lambda function _(to launch an EC2 instance)_
- [ ] EC2 Instance _(g4dn.xlarge)_ with a custom AMI _(with the UE5 executable)_
- [ ] CloudWatch Alarm + Lambda _(when NetworkIn = 0 for 5 minutes on an instance, a Lambda is triggered to terminate the instance)_

Other:
- [ ] Basic frontend (just a button and something to call the API and give back the instance IP)

## How it works?
1. On the frontend you request for an instance
2. The request is forwarded to a Lambda trough an API Gateway
3. The Lambda launch an EC2 instance and answer with the IP through the API Gateway
4. The frontend show the IP
5. Pixel Streaming! ðŸŽ‰
